At Make School, I built Make Mentor (Ruby on Rails) that allows undergraduates to easily connect and meet with alumni at their colleges. Students can discover and connect with mentors more easily than ever before. Before Make School, I co-founded Teptu, a not-for-profit that provides high schoolers that are passionate in STEM research opportunities to build entrepreneurial skills. I led a team (~ 12 people ) to organize a science competition where more than 300 NYC high schoolers applied. Teptu is sponsored by companies such as Microsoft and WeWork. My previous education included chemical engineering at MIT. I bring a diverse set of software development, product development and science research skills to any technical position. I have experience with Ruby on Rails, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and iOS development.",

      bio: "I was born and raised in the Bay Area as a first generation Afro-Latino. I wrote my first line of code sophomore year of high school in a program called SMASH Academy. That first exposure led to two years at UC Santa Cruz as a Computer Science Major. During some time off, Make School was recommended to me, and I attended the 2016 Summer Academy. Since then, I've shipped my first app to the app store, got second place in a hackathon, and third place at a Startup Weekend. Seeing just how much I could accomplish with only two months of experience in IOS development, I’m excited to see what I’ll be able to accomplish and create in the future.",
